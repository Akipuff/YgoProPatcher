# YgoProPatcher
YgoProPatcher that patches YGOPRO2 using YGOPRO Percy Links Beta files

Simple program that I made for my friend that wanted to have an automated tool to update YGOPRO2
The app uses YGOPRO Percy Links Beta files to update YGOPRO2,
so it's required for one to update it before trying to do it with this app.

The app doesn't integrate in YGOPRO2 or YGOPRO1 code, it's just a simple way of copying files required to have newest YuGiOh Cards
added in YGOPRO Percy Links in YGOPRO2.

Tested on Koishi Server against AI, new cards worked.
