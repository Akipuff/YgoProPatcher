## **CHECK RELEASES TAB FOR THE NEWEST UPDATER FILE**

Simple program that I made for my friend that wanted to have an automated tool to update YGOPRO2
The app uses YGOPRO Percy Links Beta files to update YGOPRO2,
so it's required to have YGOPRO Percy Links Beta updated, and with new card images loaded before trying to update YGOPRO2 with this app.

The app doesn't integrate in YGOPRO2 or YGOPRO1 code, it's just a simple way of copying files required to have the newest YuGiOh Cards
added in YGOPRO Percy Links in YGOPRO2.

Tested on Koishi Server against AI, new cards worked.
